## Getting Started

The front-end has been built using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

The back-end environment is managed via [Docker](https://docker.com).

Real-time communication between the back-and-front-end is handled using [SocketIO](https://socket.io/).

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Make sure Docker is installed and running, then start the dev environment
npm start

# The server should now be running on http://localhost/ ðŸŽ‰
```

For a production environment replace `npm start` with `npm run start:production`.

## Contributing

Mentally Friendly loves contributions from the community!

### Filing Bugs

If you find an issue, please do file it on the repository.

### Contributing Pull Requests

PR's are even better than issues. We gladly accept community pull requests. In general there are a few necessary steps before we can accept a pull request:

- Open an issue describing the problem that you are looking to solve in your PR (if one is not already open), and your approach to solving it. This makes it easier to have a conversation around the best general approach for solving your problem, outside of the code itself.
- Fork the repo you're making the fix on to your own Github account.
- Code!
- Submit your PR, making sure it references the issue you opened.
- If your PR fixes a bug, make sure the issue includes clear steps to reproduce the bug so we can test your fix.

If you've completed all of these steps the core team will do their best to respond to the PR as soon as possible.
